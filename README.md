# Flexbox and Media Queries Webpage Challenge:

Go to [common flexbox patterns](https://tobiasahlin.com/blog/common-flexbox-patterns/)

Pick a layout to recreate, and recreate the layout as a group into a webpage - but make it your own!

Your page must have a theme 
  - movies
  - cat breeds
  - a grocery list
  - life advice
  - etc

You must use flexbox and media queries

Some of your elements must change colour at different breakpoints

OPTIONAL: Your page must include an image, and a navbar.

As a group, you can make one page all together or each create the same page on your laptops - but make sure you all end up with a copy of the completed code!
